BC Generate Static Cache extension TODO
==========================

There are still quite a lot of features we could
add to BC Generate Static Cache.

A few users of BC Generate Static Cache may require further
extension of the default solution to include addition features.

If you are interested in sponsoring the development
of any of these features for your eZ Publish web site,
please contact info@brookinsconsulting.com

Features for consideration:

- Delay static cache fetching and storage
- Option to use staticcache.ini configuration
